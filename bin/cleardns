# Script to unload and reload mDNS as it is a bit crappy in OS X
#
# As Apple points out, you might need to do this in the following situation:
# "OS X keeps a local cache of resolved DNS queries for a time defined by
# the DNS server, but sometimes it may be necessary to reset the cache
# immediately and re-query a DNS server. For example, you might do this
# after an entry on the server is changed or a new entry is added."
#
# Alternatively:
#   sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
#
# Also if you run this command you will get a very detailed report
# in /var/logs/system.log of the state of your cache etc.
#   sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder
#
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
echo "mDNS unloaded"
sleep 5
sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
echo "mDNS loaded"
sleep 5
echo "Hopefully you can get on with browsing again"
